<h1>How it Works</h1>
<h2>Choose Your Assay</h2>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Order cutting-edge biomarker tests such as metabolomics and proteomics for a deeper understanding of your health and wellness.&nbsp; <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1M-49o5pilziAEqTTiE4oZJudrZvjcWJH/view?usp=sharing">Sample Report</a></p>
<h2>Provide a Sample</h2>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Arrange a blood draw by one of our licensed professionals, either walk-in at the OpenCures Lab in Novato or a convenient remote draw at your home.</p>
<h2>Manage Your Results</h2>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Use the OpenCures Self-Directed Research Platform to dig deep into your results.&nbsp; Track your health, find optimize your health, evaluate health interventions.</p>
<h1>How it's Different</h1>
<p><strong>Beyond Genomics</strong><br>OpenCures provides you with real-time information about your current state of health based on levels of metabolites and other biomarkers that DNA sequence alone can’t provide.</p>
<p><strong>It’s YOUR Research</strong><br>You own your samples stored in the OpenCures BioBank and results obtained from their analysis.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Personal Insights</strong><br>If you can’t measure it, you can’t manage it, so use our help to measure your health at the highest resolution possible!</p>
<p><strong>Group Research</strong><br>Only OpenCures gives you the power of sharing your data with others to create community-driven research projects.</p>

<h2>The Shop</h2>
<p>OpenCures is located in the SF Bay Area on 823 Grant Ave. in Novato, California, two blocks from the SMART Train and just off the Delong exit to the 101. Come visit us to ask questions or join an educational seminar.</p>
<h2>The Lab</h2>
<p>It all starts with a blood draw, potentially from anywhere, but here at our Novato Center for Self-Directed Research we use certified mobile phlebotomists from <a href="https://www.bayareapls.com/">Bay Area Phlebotomy and Lab Services</a>.</p>
<h2>The BioBank</h2>
<p>Your blood “biospecimen” is split into multiple aliquots and sent for analysis for the tests you ordered, or stored in the OpenCures Biobank.</p>
