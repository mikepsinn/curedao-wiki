<h1 style="text-align:center;">Executive Summary</h1>
<p>Our platform collects and aggregate data on symptoms, diet, sleep, exercise, weather, medication, and anything else from dozens of life-tracking apps and devices. Then it analyzes this data to reveal hidden factors exacerbating or improving symptoms of chronic illness.</p>
<h3>Value Proposition</h3>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:672px;"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/NXgK3OpfVVlPgvacds-d2j26ibfgtXectY36FT_UU1dkRwxr6RXsp43bQ2DtEfRu8C5FuVQTNkQMMnDfuRUEEB4_zOEjuVLUbAZNizvWTiw-Hzhk1AcUzMdFU77BlArmgBwHweLD=s0"></figure>
<p>Nearly half of Americans suffer from at least one chronic condition, and the number is growing.&nbsp; The severity of many of these conditions such as arthritis, depression, hypertension, ADHD, anxiety and diabetes can be influenced by hundreds of factors in daily life.&nbsp; Human minds do not have the bandwidth or statistical processing power required to account for all these factors, their synergistic relationships, and the time delays before their effects are observed.&nbsp; So we built a platform that harvests the data from new self-tracking technologies and mines it to help individuals discover which hidden factors are worsening or improving their condition.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

</ul>
<h3>Target Market</h3>
<p>The primary targets include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>End-Users - The <a href="http://thedoctorweighsin.com/tracking-health-indicators-the-role-of-mhealth-technologies-in-improving-outcomes/"><u>613 million people</u></a> who track a health indicator electronically and would like an effortless way to derive actionable insights from their data.</li>
  <li>Physicians who would like to gain greater insights into the root causes of their patient’s conditions and identify the optimal treatments and dosages.</li>
  <li>Health application developers to easily aggregate and analyze their user’s data</li>
</ul>
<h3>Business Model</h3>
<p>1. Freemium Consumer Subscription - generates revenue through a subscription freemium model for end-users of the product at $6/month.</p>
<p>2. Developer Platform - It also provides a usage-based subscription platform for health application developers starting at $0.50/end-user per month.</p>
<p>3. Ad Revenue - By anonymizing and mining the data obtained from these individuals, we can use it to inform the 2 billion people who search for health information online every year via the Search Engine.&nbsp; Like Google, our revenue is generated by clicks on targeted ads adjacent to these search results.&nbsp; Google shares <a href="http://www.2createawebsite.com/money/google-adsense.html"><u>68%</u></a> of their revenue from each click, producing an average net return of $1.90 per click.</p>
<p>4. Sponsored Apps - Sponsor apps using the platform can be provided to hospitals, insurers, and pharmaceutical companies who wish to improve patient outcomes and potentially gather patient-authorized anonymized patient data. Pricing would follow a subscription model starting at $2 per end-user per month.&nbsp;</p>
