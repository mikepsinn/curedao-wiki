Maybe you'll have better luck, but for some reason, it refuses to load in Chrome for some.  However, it generally works on Firefox.&#x20;

1. Open Firefox
2. Install Metamask and add the Harmony Chain and our token as [described here](../how-to/get-tokens.md)
3. Go to [https://client.aragon.org](https://client.aragon.org/)
4. Connect with harmony wallet
5. Type `curedao` in Find Existing Org
