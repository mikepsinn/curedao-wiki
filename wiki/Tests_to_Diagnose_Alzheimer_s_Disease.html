<p>Early Onset Alzheimer's makes up 10% of all people with Alzheimer's disease.
</p><p><br />
The three single-gene mutations associated with early-onset Alzheimer's disease are:
</p>
<ul><li>Amyloid precursor protein (APP) on chromosome 21</li>
<li>Presenilin 1 (PSEN1) on chromosome 14</li>
<li>Presenilin 2 (PSEN2) on chromosome 1</li></ul>
<p>People with down syndrome carry a greater risk of developing Alzheimer's because they are born with an extra chromosome with carries the APP gene mutation.
</p><p>There is no blood test that can predict 100% if a person gets Alzheimer's rather one that shows your risk of developing it.

<p>No blood tests can currently diagnose Alzheimer's before symptoms develop but other tests are currently in development. <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/blood-tests-show-promise-early-alzheimers-diagnosis">https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/blood-tests-show-promise-early-alzheimers-diagnosis</a>
