<h1>Relative Risk (RR)</h1><div class="mw-parser-output"><p>The <b>relative risk (RR)</b> or <b>risk ratio</b> is the ratio of the probability of an outcome in an exposed group to the probability of an outcome in an unexposed group. Together with risk difference and odds ratio, relative risk measures the association between the exposure and the outcome.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Statistical_use_and_meaning">Statistical use and meaning</span></h2>
<p>Relative risk is used in the statistical analysis of the data of ecological, cohort, medical and intervention studies, to estimate the strength of the association between exposures (treatments or risk factors) and outcomes. Mathematically, it is the expressed as the incidence rate of the outcome in the exposed group divided by the outcome of the unexposed group. As such, it is used to compare the risk of an adverse outcome when receiving a medical treatment versus no treatment (or placebo), or when exposed to an environmental risk factor versus not exposed. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Example">Example</span></h3>
<p>In a study examining the effect of a drug on the occurrence of a disease:
</p>
<ul><li>8.8% of placebo-treated patients experienced the disease</li>
<li>1.7% of patients treated with the drug experienced the disease</li></ul>
<p>Therefore, the risk ratio is calculated as 1.7/8.8, which is 0.19. 
</p><p>This can be interpreted as those receiving the drug had 19% the risk of getting the disease than did patients receiving the placebo. In this case, the drug is considered to be a protective factor rather than a risk factor because it is associated with causing a reduced risk of disease.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Interpretation_of_Value">Interpretation of Value</span></h3>
<p>Assuming the causal effect between the exposure and the outcome, values of RR can be interpreted as follows:
</p>
<ul><li>RR = 1 means that exposure does not affect the outcome</li>
<li>RR &lt; 1 means that the risk of the outcome is decreased by the exposure, which can be called a "protective factor"</li>
<li>RR &gt; 1 means that the risk of the outcome is increased by the exposure</li></ul>
