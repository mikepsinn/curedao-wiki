<h1>Neuroinflammation</h1><div class="mw-parser-output"><p>Neuroinflammation is an inflammatory response within the brain or spinal cord.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Depression">Depression</span></h2>
<p>Depressed patients present increased plasma levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and neuroinflammatory alterations.
</p><p>Male rats received amitriptyline (AMI) a tricyclic, S-citalopram (ESC) a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, tranylcypromine (TCP) a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, vortioxetine (VORT) a multimodal AD or saline for ten days.
</p><p>Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165032719326539">induces</a> despair-like, impaired motivation/self-care behavior and caused <a href="https://wiki.crowdsourcingcures.org/wiki/Anhedonia" title="Anhedonia">anhedonia</a>.
</p><p>All ADs prevented LPS-induced despair-like behavior.
</p><p>Only VORT rescued impaired self-care behavior.
</p><p>All ADs prevented LPS-induced increase in brain pro-inflammatory cytokines [interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6] and T-helper 1 cytokines [tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Î± and interferon-Î³].
</p><p>VORT increased striatal and hypothalamic IL-4 levels.
</p><p>All ADs prevented LPS-induced neuroendocrine alterations represented by increased levels of hypothalamic nitrite and plasma corticosterone response.
</p><p>VORT and ESC prevented LPS-induced increase in NF-kBp65 hippocampal expression.
</p><p>ESC, TCP and VORT, but not IMI, prevented the alterations in phospho-CREB expression.

<p>Inflammation is regulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that are expressed by immune and non-immune cells. Their dysregulation is a hallmark of chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Significant evidence supports that monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor drugs have anti-inflammatory effects. MAO inhibitors are principally prescribed for the management of a variety of central nervous system (CNS)-associated diseases such as depression, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's; however, they also have anti-inflammatory effects in the CNS and a variety of non-CNS tissues. To bolster support for their development as anti-inflammatories, it is critical to elucidate their mechanism(s) of action.
</p><p>MAO inhibitors decrease the generation of end products such as:
</p>
<ul><li>hydrogen peroxide</li>
<li>aldehyde</li>
<li>ammonium</li></ul>
<p>They also inhibit biogenic amine degradation, and this increases cellular and pericellular catecholamines in a variety of immune and some non-immune cells. This decrease in end product metabolites and increase in catecholamines can play a significant role in the anti-inflammatory effects of MAO inhibitors.
